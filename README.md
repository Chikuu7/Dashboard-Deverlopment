📊 Task 3 – Dashboard Development and Data Visualization
📘 Overview

The objective of this task is to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key insights from a dataset using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Dash (Python).
This task demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into meaningful, visual stories that aid decision-making. The focus is on designing dashboards that are dynamic, user-friendly, and insight-driven, allowing users to explore trends, patterns, and KPIs interactively.

🎯 Goals

Import and clean a dataset for visualization.

Design a dashboard layout with interactive filters, charts, and KPIs.

Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends over time.

Communicate insights effectively through data storytelling and visual hierarchy.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Dashboard Tools	Power BI 

Data Preparation	Python (Pandas, NumPy) or Excel

Visualization Libraries (optional)	Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Environment	Tableau Desktop, Power BI Desktop, or Jupyter Notebook (Dash App)
🧮 Workflow

Data Import and Cleaning

Load the dataset (e.g., CSV, Excel, or database).

Handle missing values and correct inconsistencies.

Perform data transformations (date formatting, categorization, grouping).

KPI Identification

Define metrics to highlight (e.g., total sales, pass rate, average grades, or user engagement).

Choose dimensions for analysis (region, gender, time period, category, etc.).

Dashboard Design

Create visual elements such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, maps, and trend plots.

Use interactive components (filters, slicers, dropdowns) to allow dynamic data exploration.

Apply color themes and formatting to enhance readability and visual appeal.

Insight Generation

Highlight patterns and relationships between different variables.

Identify areas of improvement, anomalies, or growth opportunities.

Provide actionable insights using KPIs and visual summaries.
